/* 
data we need to track:
  -- solution
    -- 5 letter string, e.g. 'drain'
  -- past guesses
    -- an array of past guesses
    -- each past guess is an array of letter objects [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
    -- each object represents a letter in the guess word {letter: 'a', color: 'yellow'}
  -- current guess
    -- string 'hello'
  -- keypad letters
    -- array of letter objects [{key: 'a', color: 'green'}, {}, {} ...]
  -- number of turns
    -- an integer 0 - 6

game process:
  -- entering words:
    -- user enters a letter & a square is filled with that letter
    -- when a user hits delete it deletes the previous letter
    -- when a user hits enter it submits the word
      -- if all squares are not filled with letters then the word is not submitted
      -- if that word has already been used in a prev guess then the word is not submitted
